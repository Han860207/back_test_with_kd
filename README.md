# back_test_with_kd
Using python to back_test manipulate with KD value. When initially K < 20 and golden cross, we set it as a buy signal, and initially K > 80 and dead cross, we set it as sell signal.

Notice : Currently support Taiwan stock only.

Notice2 : We have limited money, so we won't buy again when we already have it, on the other hand, we won't sell again when we don't have it .
